        Blood is saver of all existing lives on the earth. The probability of finding required blood components and blood groups in nearby blood banks is low, because of these reasons patient life is at risk. There were many websites are available in which donor's information and contact details are available but these details are not reliable and accurate. Considering all these problems in our existing life we coined an idea of designing a web based mobile android application to overcome existing problem. Our mobile application helps people in finding blood banks in their nearest location. This application also shows route or path for reaching blood bank easily by using GPS system. Our system maintains the stock levels of blood banks and their location and their contact details.

        If stock of any blood group reaches below threshold level our system sends notification to blood bank informing stock level. Our system also includes GPS to keep track of acceptor location and blood bank location, for finding nearest blood bank to acceptor. Our system also uses Push Technology which provides security to access private data which only viewed by authorized users and it also provides authorized features. Our system updates the blood stock in blood banks regularly before receiving and donating blood.
        Android application use GIS to track the user location. The role of our system is to keep updated and reliable information of donors, so user can view updated information about donor and blood bank.

        The goal of our system is to provide efficient quality of blood to the patient or acceptor in less time. The tremendous increase in the mobile users with the integration of cheap range of web services for better communication with other interactive devices is very useful for saving the lives of patients using this mobile application. The hardware devices are responsible for communication between the donor and requestor. The system basically consists of two types of device:
        <br>
        1) A smart phone with android operating system along the android app installed in it.
        <br>
        2) A Server (usually a pc) for the database and the website where the information can be stored easily.
